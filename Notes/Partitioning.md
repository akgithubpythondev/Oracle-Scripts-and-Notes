# Partitioning

Partitioning allows a table, index, or index-organized table to be subdivided into smaller pieces, where each piece of such a database object is called a partition. Each partition has its own name, and may optionally have its own storage characteristics.

1. Range partitioning
2. Hash partitioning
3. List partitioning
4. Interval partitioning
5. Composite partitioning
