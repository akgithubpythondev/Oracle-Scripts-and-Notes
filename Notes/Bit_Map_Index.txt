Bit map index

CREATE BITMAP INDEX
emp_bitmap_idx
ON index_demo (gender);

exec dbms_stats.gather_index_stats(OWNNAME=>'SCOTT', INDNAME=>'EMP_BITMAP_IDX');

select /*+ index(emp emp_bitmap_idx) */
   count(*)
from
   emp, dept
where
   emp.deptno = dept.deptno;

bitmap indexes are only suitable for static tables and materialized views which are updated 
at night and rebuilt after batch row loading.  
If your tables are not read-only during query time, DO NOT consider using bitmap indexes!

1 - 7 distinct key values - Queries against bitmap indexes with a low cardinality are very fast.

8-100 distinct key values - As the number if distinct values increases, performance decreases proportionally.

100 - 10,000 distinct key values - Over 100 distinct values, the bitmap indexes become huge and 
SQL performance drops off rapidly.

Over 10,000 distinct key values - At this point, performance is ten times slower than an index 
with only 100 distinct values.
